# 🤖 Thoughtful AI – Support Agent

This is my submission for the AI Technical Screen challenge.  
It’s a simple customer support chatbot built with **Streamlit** and a hardcoded FAQ dataset.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts user questions in a conversational format
- Retrieves the most relevant hardcoded answer (TF-IDF + cosine similarity)
- Falls back to a polite message (or OpenAI API if enabled)
- Clean chat UI with Streamlit
